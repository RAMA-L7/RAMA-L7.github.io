    <h2>🔍 What Is Prompt Engineering?</h2>
    <p>Prompt engineering is the skill of designing effective instructions and inputs for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. It is about shaping AI outputs by structuring language the right way — using logic, creativity, and control.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>📜 History & Evolution</h2>
    <p>The concept emerged around 2020 with GPT-3, but grew mainstream in 2022–2023 with tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Early prompt engineers were developers, researchers, and creators experimenting with new AI behavior through language alone. Now, it's a core skill for anyone building AI-powered solutions.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Why Prompt Engineering Matters</h2>
    <p>LLMs are powerful but directionless. Prompt engineering provides structure, constraints, and creativity — guiding the AI like a circuit guides current. It’s essential for AI accuracy, safety, and practical utility.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">🧠 Featured Prompts</h2>

  <div class="prompt-card">
    <h3>📌 Personal Portfolio Summary from Chat History</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Automatically summarize identity, skills, and learning goals from past conversations to build a portfolio.</p>
    <pre>"I want to know about myself — what you know about me, what I’m doing, what I’m trying to learn with every topic and query. Give a detailed summary so I can turn it into a portfolio and showcase my work across different domains."</pre>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Generated a complete personal profile + skills roadmap + bio used across site.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="prompt-card">
    <h3>📝 Medium Article Generator from VLSI Concepts</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Create human-style blog titles by comparing VLSI engineering to real life analogies.</p>
    <pre>"Now consider you are a Medium article writer. Suggest me articles related to VLSI design, but compared to real-life human situations. For example: ‘The Invisible Blueprint: What VLSI Design Taught Me About Building a Focused Life.’"</pre>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Series of article ideas, outlines, and final blogs now on personal site.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="prompt-card">
    <h3>🎧 Emotional Support Listener Resume Assistant</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Translate soft-skill training into professional resume points and job role alignment.</p>
    <pre>“I just finished a listener course on 7 Cups and scored 42/46. I want to include this in my resume. Also help me find matching job titles like listener, emotional supporter. Suggest me resume points, job boards, and practical tips.”</pre>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Resume section written, new job categories suggested, added to portfolio.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="prompt-card">
    <h3>🧰 Real-Time Prompt Engineer Resume Customizer</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Craft a prompt engineer resume from live chat data and project summaries.</p>
    <pre>“Prepare a resume for this job posting I saw from Zetheta Algorithms. I don’t have many projects, but I want to show my prompting knowledge. Use only what I’ve done with you here.”</pre>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Clean, job-matching resume generated and uploaded to GitHub.</p>
